JungleTree is an event-driven, modern Minecraft Server. The goal is to produce a server that is designed primarily for server owners who wish to better utilize their hardware. The minimum viable product is currently in development. The software is built from the ground-up, and has been optimized for multi-core environments.

The project's overall goals are:

* Enterprise friendly
* Containerized by design
* Flexible framework for data storage, backed by NoSQL and memory caching
* Scalable, with load balancing on multiple levels
* Native support for GeoLocation-based distribution, without the use of BungeeCord
* Java and Pocket Edition Support
* Modular API for developers
* Hotswap plugins on-the-fly
