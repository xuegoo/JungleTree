# JungleTree

JungleTree is an event-driven, modern Minecraft Server. The goal is to produce a server that is designed primarily for server owners who wish to better utilize their hardware. The minimum viable product is currently in development. The software is built from the ground-up, and has been optimized for multi-core environments.

The project's overall goals are:

* Enterprise friendly
* World data stored in a SQL Database
* Built-in logging and rollback
* Scalable
* Minimal hardware requirements
* Ability to be load balanced
